# <b>_Weighted-Graph_ 🔢 </b>

_Show step by step of Dijkstra and Floyd warshall algorithms on a weighted graph implemented in java_

## <b>_Instructions_</b> 📑

_First of all, you need to modify the <b>src/Main.java</b> to build your Graph of n vertex._<br>

_After that you add the edges between them following this format <b>g.addEdge(Source, Destination, Weight)</b>._<br>

_Finally, run the code and it will print step by step the Dijkstra and Floyd Warshall algorithms_

## <b>_Build With_</b> 🛠️

* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/co/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) - Scripting language.
* [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/) - IDE.
